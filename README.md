# Export data to Excel with ASP.NET Core

This repository holds the code sample for my blog post [Export data to Excel with ASP.NET Core](https://arminzia.com/blog/export-data-to-excel-with-aspnet-core/).

The project was created with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.  
There's only one dependency, the [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) NuGet package.
